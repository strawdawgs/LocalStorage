# LocalStorage
Sending data from one webpage to another on a local machine.

This project shows a simple example of how to use the "localStorage" object to send input data to another webpage on the same machine.

You have to enter in input on the sender page first, then click the "Send" button to save the data to the "localStorage" object.

Then you go to the receiver page and click the "Refresh" button to show the input information on the receiver page.

Note: I use borders around every single element inside the page. It helps me see exactly how and where elements interact with one another. I'm leaving the borders on to show others the same thing.
