# LocalStorage
Sending data from one webpage to another on a local machine.

This project shows a simple example of how to use the "localStorage" object to send input data to another webpage on the same machine.

Note: I use borders around every single element inside the page. It helps me see exactly how and where elements interact with one another. I'm leaving the borders on to show others the same thing.
